1. A User Interface is what the user is shown and
given access to on a website. It's where humans 
and computers interact.

2. A UI is what you see on a webpage while the UX
is what the user can do or does on the webpage.

3. A Mock-up is a sketch that represents the way the 
website will look.
    1. Low Fidelity: typically sketched designs 
    without user interaction.
    2. High Fidelity: computer based designs that
    allow user interaction.

4. Mobile First design is a design philosophy that works
by creating the interface on the smallest (mobile) screens 
and working up to larger monitors.

5. The User should be in control of the UI

6. Typically like in React components, it's reusable
lines of code.
